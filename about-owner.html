            <h1>About Owner</h1>
            <p>My name is Yaya Yamashita. I am a student at LCC International University. I am studying communication. Currently I live in Klaipeda, Lithuania. I was born and raised in Japan. I started my dance career when I was three years old. Stage is my passion. I got interested in making accessories because I started to make earrings and necklaces for the performance. In my dance team, I was responsible for costumes and accessories.

            <h2>Making Accessories</h2>
            <p>I usually get inspired by clothes and some beads. First, I decide what I want to use in the middle. And then, I start to design what kind of color tone and size will suit the theme. If I get an order from a customer, I ask for a lot of details and I try to create accessories that they want. Also, I can make accessories for metal allergies.
